# My Arabic Journey

This is an web-based Application designed as learning system using Game Quiz. There will be 3 (three) categories, Family, Animal, and Body Part. Users will start
by default on Family Category and should finish the learning path which include learning session and quiz session before being able to continue to the next
category. 

## Target User

We target this web application primarly for kids at 8-10 age who did not have any background on learning 'Arabic. We focus on words or categories that close to 
their daily life. Therefore, for those who outside our primarly target user still feel the convenient of our system since we focus on highlighting the content 
of education while giving fun atmosphere at the same time.
